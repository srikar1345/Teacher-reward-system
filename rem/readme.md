# Teacher Performance Reward Smart Contract
![alt text](image-3.png)

## Vision

The `TeacherPerformanceReward` smart contract is designed to reward teachers based on their performance metrics. By evaluating teacher performance through a set of criteria, the contract facilitates the distribution of rewards in the form of Ether. This system aims to incentivize high-quality teaching and recognize the efforts of educators.

## Project Features

- **Performance Evaluation**: Allows an admin to set performance metrics for teachers based on student feedback, student improvement, peer reviews, and teacher experience.
- **Reward Mechanism**: Grants rewards to teachers who meet or exceed a specified performance threshold.
- **Eligibility Check**: Provides a function to check if a teacher is eligible for a reward based on their performance score.
- **Ether Deposit**: The contract can accept Ether deposits, which can then be used for rewards.

## Future Scope

1. **Dynamic Reward System**: Implement dynamic reward amounts based on the performance score rather than a fixed value.
2. **Enhanced Performance Metrics**: Expand the performance criteria to include additional metrics or weights.
3. **Multi-Level Admin Roles**: Introduce multi-level admin roles for more granular control over reward distribution.
4. **User Interface**: Develop a front-end application to interact with the contract, making it easier for admins to set performance data and manage rewards.
5. **Integration with Educational Platforms**: Integrate with existing educational platforms to automatically fetch and update performance metrics.
6. **Security Audits**: Conduct formal security audits to ensure the robustness of the contract.
